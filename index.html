  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 2025-11-27</small></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the “Blue Eagles – Team Manager” app (“the App”)
    handles personal data of users and team members.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The App is a private tool used only by the Blue Eagles amateur basketball team.
    For any privacy questions or data deletion requests, please contact:
    <br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> andrew.negrini@gmail.com
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App may process the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account data: email address, display name, authentication ID (via Supabase).</li>
    <li>Team roster data: player names, jersey numbers, positions, short bios, optional profile photos.</li>
    <li>Game data: opponents, dates, locations, notes, scores, convocations, per-player game stats.</li>
    <li>User-generated content: team photos and album descriptions.</li>
    <li>Technical identifiers: Supabase user ID and push notification tokens (via OneSignal).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <p>All data is used exclusively to provide the App’s functionality, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing the season schedule and game information.</li>
    <li>Displaying the team roster and player profiles.</li>
    <li>Recording and reviewing game statistics.</li>
    <li>Sharing internal team photos and albums.</li>
    <li>Sending team-related push notifications (practice changes, game reminders, new albums).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Data is <strong>not</strong> used for advertising, tracking, or analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis and Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children and access is restricted to invited team members,
    staff, and relatives. Use of the App is based on the legitimate interest of the team
    to organize activities and communicate internally.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App relies on the following providers acting as processors:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Supabase</strong> – authentication, database, and file storage (team data and media).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>OneSignal</strong> – delivery of push notifications using device tokens.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services process data only on behalf of the App and do not use it for
    their own marketing or profiling, according to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Storage, Security and Location</h2>
  <p>
    Data is stored on Supabase databases and storage buckets and protected by standard
    technical and organizational measures. All communication with the backend services
    is encrypted using HTTPS. Access to the App is restricted to authenticated users.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data is retained as long as the team uses the App or until deletion is requested.
    Users or players may ask for correction or removal of their data by contacting
    the email address provided above. Upon request, the developer will remove or
    anonymize the relevant records from Supabase and revoke push notification tokens.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 and is not publicly available.
    Only invited users with valid credentials can access the App. If you believe
    data about a child has been collected without authorization, please contact us
    so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The “Last updated” date
    at the top of the page will be modified accordingly. Continued use of the App
    after any changes means you accept the revised policy.
  </p>
